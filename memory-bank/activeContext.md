# Active Context: Anki API Tools

## Current Focus
The project currently focuses on providing a stable, well-documented Node.js interface to the AnkiConnect API. The initial implementation includes core functionality for retrieving card information, listing decks and models, managing notes, and controlling card states.

## Recent Changes
- Created the foundational AnkiApi class with Promise-based methods
- Implemented a 1-second delay mechanism to prevent overloading Anki
- Developed utility scripts for demonstrating API functionality
- Documented the API methods and usage patterns

## Active Decisions

### API Design Decisions
1. **Promise-Based Interface**: All methods return Promises for consistent async handling
2. **Deliberate Rate Limiting**: 1-second delay between API calls to ensure Anki stability
3. **Error Handling Strategy**: Consistent error handling with informative messages
4. **No External Dependencies**: Using only built-in Node.js modules for simplicity

### Implementation Considerations
1. **Modularity**: The AnkiApi class is designed to be easily imported into other projects
2. **Extensibility**: The class structure allows for easy addition of new AnkiConnect methods
3. **Documentation**: JSDoc comments and README provide comprehensive usage guidance
4. **Command-Line Usability**: Scripts can be run directly from the command line

## Next Steps

### Short-term Priorities
1. **Testing**: Add comprehensive testing for the API methods
2. **Documentation Improvements**: Expand examples and usage scenarios
3. **Error Handling Enhancements**: More specific error types and recovery strategies

### Medium-term Goals
1. **Type Definitions**: Add TypeScript definitions for better IDE support
2. **Additional Utility Methods**: Add more convenience methods for common operations
3. **Batch Operation Support**: Improve the multi-action functionality

### Long-term Vision
1. **Higher-Level Abstractions**: Create task-oriented methods that combine multiple API calls
2. **GUI Integration**: Potential for a simple GUI to manage Anki through this API
3. **Extended Ecosystem**: Develop additional tools that leverage this API for specific use cases

## Active Challenges
1. **AnkiConnect Compatibility**: Ensuring compatibility with different versions of AnkiConnect
2. **Error Scenarios**: Handling various error conditions gracefully
3. **Performance Optimization**: Balancing API throttling with performance needs
4. **Use Case Discovery**: Identifying the most valuable features to prioritize
