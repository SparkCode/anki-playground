# Progress: Anki API Tools

## Current Status
The Anki API Tools project is in an initial functional state with core API features implemented and basic utility scripts available. The project provides a Node.js interface to the AnkiConnect API with an emphasis on reliability and ease of use.

## What Works

### Core API Methods
- ✅ Connecting to AnkiConnect and verifying the version
- ✅ Retrieving information about the current card
- ✅ Listing available decks and note types (models)
- ✅ Finding notes by query
- ✅ Getting note information
- ✅ Adding new notes
- ✅ Adding new notes with media via guiAddCards
- ✅ Updating existing notes
- ✅ Suspending and unsuspending cards
- ✅ Opening the Anki browser with a specific query
- ✅ Getting card information
- ✅ Finding cards by deck
- ✅ Executing multiple actions in one request

### Utility Scripts
- ✅ `anki-current-card.js`: Script to display current card information
- ✅ `example.js`: Script demonstrating various API functionalities

### Infrastructure
- ✅ API throttling with 1-second delay between calls
- ✅ Promise-based API methods
- ✅ Error handling for common scenarios
- ✅ Documentation in README and JSDoc comments

## What's Left to Build

### Core Functionality
- ⬜ Comprehensive test suite
- ⬜ TypeScript type definitions
- ⬜ Additional AnkiConnect API methods not yet implemented

### Tooling and Utilities
- ⬜ CLI tool with more command-line options
- ⬜ Interactive mode for card browsing
- ⬜ Batch processing utilities for common tasks

### Documentation and Examples
- ⬜ More example scripts for common use cases
- ⬜ API reference documentation
- ⬜ Troubleshooting guide
- ⬜ Usage tutorials

### Quality and Performance
- ⬜ Automated testing
- ⬜ Performance benchmarks
- ⬜ Edge case handling improvements
- ⬜ Configuration options for different usage scenarios

## Known Issues
1. **Error Handling**: Some edge cases may not be properly handled
2. **AnkiConnect Compatibility**: May not work with all versions of AnkiConnect
3. **Limited Field Validation**: Minimal validation of input parameters
4. **Missing Methods**: Some AnkiConnect API methods are not yet implemented

## Next Development Priorities
1. Add unit and integration tests
2. Implement additional AnkiConnect methods
3. Create more example scripts for common use cases
4. Add TypeScript definitions
5. Improve error handling for edge cases
