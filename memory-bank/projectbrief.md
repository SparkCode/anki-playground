# Project Brief - Anki Playground

## Overview
Anki Playground is a collection of tools and utilities for interacting with and extending the Anki flashcard system. The project aims to enhance Anki's functionality through custom interfaces, automation tools, and AI-assisted card generation.

## Core Components

### 1. Anki Card Generator
A web application that helps users create Anki flashcards using AI assistance (via OpenRouter/LLM APIs). It offers a user-friendly interface for generating cards and directly adding them to Anki decks.

### 2. Anki Playground Scripts
A collection of JavaScript and Python utilities that interact with Anki's API to perform various tasks:
- `anki-cli.js`: Command-line interface for Anki operations
- `anki-direct-ui.js`: Direct UI interaction with Anki
- `anki_gui.py`: Python-based GUI for Anki interactions
- `anki-api.js`: JavaScript wrapper for the Anki Connect API
- `anki-current-card.js`: Utility for working with the current flashcard

## Primary Goals
1. Simplify the creation of high-quality Anki flashcards
2. Automate repetitive tasks in Anki workflow
3. Provide AI assistance for creating more effective learning materials
4. Bridge the gap between external data sources and Anki's system

## User Focus
- Language learners seeking to create vocabulary cards efficiently
- Students looking to generate question-answer pairs from study materials
- Anki power users who want to extend and automate Anki's capabilities
- Developers interested in building on top of Anki's API

## Project Status
This project is under active development with multiple components at different stages of completion.
